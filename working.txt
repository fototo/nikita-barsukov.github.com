How i created this thing.

0. Came across good dataset from http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=2560 - registration required.

1. Find good shapefile of danish adm boundaries.

GADL - old boundaries. FOund good shapefile at http://kortforsyningen.dk/

2. Choosing right tool for a job.

ggplot - weird graph. Decided d3 - interactivity + good tutorials.
R - data manipulation, filtering etc.

3. First steps - zoomable map of Danish communes.
Based on http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/ + http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2206590

4. Deciding what data about foreigners in danmark to display.
R scripts to .csv

5. Using this tutorial to make a choropleth map: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606

6. Adding a legend. A bit harder. No good tutorial, using a code from here: https://github.com/jsundram/d3-choropleth/blob/master/choropleth.js + tweaks from d3js documentation.
moveToFront() function is from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14167863/how-can-i-bring-a-circle-to-the-front-with-d3

7. Adding more graphs - making a plotting function.
